# Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Simulator

## About Our Project

The objective of this work is to simulate an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) service using Assembly Language Program (ALP) on EMU8086. The need for this work arises when a simulator with a basic interface can help people with less technical knowledge (Technologically Impaired People) to understand the features of an ATM. Also, implementing an application normally implemented with high-level languages in assembly language instead can help us to learn the fundamental concepts of a Microprocessor.

## Outcomes & Applications

The outcome of this work is a fully functioning simulation of an ATM that can simulate standard ATM services like withdrawal, deposit, check balance and pin or password change. Learning Assembly Language Programming and the usage of EMU8086 is quite important as Microprocessor is a Core Course in many universities. The use of assembly language programs helped us to directly interact with processor features and instructions while developing our ATM simulator. We were able to directly optimize instructions and memory for maximum computational and memory efficiency.

## Techniques

- **Arrays**: Arrays for user IDs, user passwords and balances.
- **Direct/Indirect Addressing**: Offsets of arrays, and accessing indexes.
- **Direct /Indirect Conditional Statements**: Do-While/While loops, Compare/Jump statements.
- **Procedures/Nested Procedures**: Functions for Credentials, withdraw, deposit, transfer, display etc. Use of PROTO/PROC AND INVOKE directives.
- **Uses operator**: To push registers in the stack.
- **Built-in procedures**: Gotoxy, GetTextColor, MsgAskBox etc.
- **Bubble Sort**
